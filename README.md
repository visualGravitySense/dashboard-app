Fashion Textile Waste Dashboard UI - Component Breakdown
Core Dashboard Structure
The Fashion Textile Waste Dashboard is built with a clean, modern interface designed for maximum usability while presenting complex textile waste data. Here's how the components work together:
Header Navigation System

Logo and Title Bar: The "TW" logo alongside "Textile Waste Analytics" establishes brand identity while clearly communicating the dashboard's purpose.
Navigation Tabs: The five main sections (Overview, Waste Categories, Facilities Comparison, Reduction Targets, Reports) organize information logically, with the active tab indicated by a blue highlight and underline.
Time Period Selector: Allows users to adjust the data timeframe without leaving the current view.
User Profile: Shows the current user with their initials in a circular avatar, providing access to personal settings.

Summary Metrics Row
Four key performance cards provide immediate insight into waste performance:

Total Waste: Shows overall waste volume (5,842 kg) with a positive downward trend of 8.2%.
Waste per Unit: Displays normalized waste metrics (0.37 kg per production unit).
Cost Impact: Translates waste into financial terms ($21,576), making the business case clear.
Recovery Rate: Shows percentage of waste successfully diverted from landfill (42.8%).

These cards use color-coded indicators (green for positive trends, red for negative) to provide instant visual feedback.
Waste Category Visualization

Interactive Donut Chart: Shows proportional breakdown of waste by type with a central total for quick reference.
Category Legend: Lists each waste type with corresponding percentages and consistent color coding, making the chart easily interpretable.

Waste Trend Analysis

Line Graph: Tracks two primary waste categories over time, showing fluctuations across a monthly period.
Data Points: Individual markers make specific dates identifiable for deeper analysis.

Facility Comparison

Bar Chart: Simple, effective visualization comparing waste volumes across five manufacturing facilities.
Location Labels: Clear facility names make it easy to identify problem areas (Shanghai having the highest waste).

Reduction Progress Tracker

Gauge Visualization: Shows progress toward waste reduction targets (68% of target achieved).
Contextual Metrics: Compares current performance (17.3% reduction) against the target (25%), industry average (12.8%), and best practices (28.5%).

Insights Panel

Actionable Recommendations: Three specific insights with color-coded priorities.
Context Details: Brief explanations of each insight with specific metrics or locations affected.
Action Button: Provides access to additional insights beyond the dashboard summary.

Technical Implementation
The dashboard is implemented with:

Clean HTML5 structure for proper semantic markup
CSS3 with custom variables for consistent styling
SVG visualizations for sharp, responsive charts
Grid-based layout system for organized content placement

User Interaction Flow

Users first see summary KPIs for immediate status awareness
They can quickly identify problem areas through the category and facility visualizations
The trend analysis provides historical context for current performance
The reduction progress gauge shows status toward organizational goals
Actionable insights provide clear next steps based on the data

The design prioritizes clarity and action, ensuring users can quickly understand complex waste data and identify opportunities for improvement.

Looking at your fashion textile waste dashboard, here are some high-impact UX/UI improvements that could make your test task stand out:

Add Data Filters and Interactive Elements

Create dropdown filters to segment data by product line, material type, or season
Add interactive tooltips on hover for chart elements with detailed information
Include toggle buttons to switch between different visualization types (pie vs. treemap, line vs. area charts)


Enhance Visual Hierarchy and Accessibility

Implement a color blind-friendly palette (many creatives in fashion have color vision deficiencies)
Add stronger visual cues for critical metrics (like waste exceeding targets)
Create a consistent iconography system specific to textile waste types


Provide Contextual Comparisons

Add industry benchmarking directly into charts (visual reference lines)
Create side-by-side comparisons between current period and previous periods
Show projected trends based on current data


Improve Action-Oriented Features

Add a "Quick Actions" panel with suggested next steps based on insights
Include exportable reports customized for different stakeholders (design team vs. production)
Create notification badges for metrics requiring immediate attention


Consider Mobile/Tablet Adaptations

Design a responsive version showing how critical data would appear on smaller screens
Create a simplified view for executives who might access on mobile devices
Include touch-friendly interaction patterns


Add Business Context

Connect waste metrics to financial impact (cost savings opportunities)
Show correlation between waste reduction and sustainability goals/reporting
Visualize where in the production process waste is occurring (workflow diagram)


Improve Data Storytelling

Create a "highlights" section that automatically surfaces the most significant changes
Add micro-narratives explaining potential causes of waste pattern changes
Include success stories from specific initiatives that reduced waste


Personalization Options

Allow users to save favorite views or create custom dashboards
Implement role-based views (different default displays for designers vs. production managers)
Add annotation capabilities so users can share insights with team members



These improvements would demonstrate both your technical design skills and your understanding of how to make data truly useful and actionable for fashion brands.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# UX Designer Test Task: Waste Mapping Dashboard

## Overview

Design a user interface for a dashboard that allows fashion brands to view and analyze textile waste data from their manufacturing facilities.

## Requirements

1. **Design a dashboard interface** that displays:
    
    - Summary of total waste by category (fabric scraps, rejected items, etc.)
    - Waste trends over time
    - Comparison between different manufacturing facilities
    - Potential recycling opportunities
2. **Create both:**
    
    - Low-fidelity wireframes showing the layout and information architecture
    - High-fidelity mockups of at least two key screens
3. **Develop a simple interactive prototype** demonstrating:
    
    - How users navigate between dashboard views
    - How users can filter or drill down into specific data points
    - One key interactive element of your choice (e.g., expanding a chart for details)
4. **Write a brief explanation** (max 500 words) of:
    
    - Your design decisions and how they solve user needs
    - How this dashboard helps brands make better decisions about waste management
    - Any technical considerations for implementation

## Deliverables

- Wireframes and mockups (in Figma or your preferred design tool)
- Interactive prototype (can be in Figma, InVision, or as a simple HTML/CSS/JS implementation)
- Brief explanation document
- All files submitted in a single zip file or as links to viewable online versions

## Evaluation Criteria

- Clarity and intuitiveness of the interface
- Information hierarchy and data visualization choices
- User flow and interaction design
- Technical feasibility of the solution
- Understanding of the business context and user needs

## Timeline

Please complete and submit this task within 3-5 days.

This task evaluates the candidate's ability to design for data-heavy interfaces (which seems central to Reverse Resources' platform), tests both UX and some technical skills, and remains focused on the company's sustainability mission.
